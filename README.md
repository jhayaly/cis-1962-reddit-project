# Fake Reddit Project

This works as a sort-of Reddit sort-of chatGPT, with a MongoDB database backing it.

# Development

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

To start development servers, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```
Ps. Please reach out to me if the MongoDB database does not connect successfully... because of my subscription plan, it keeps disconnecting from the current IP Address and I just have to connect it then it works :/
